                    <p>Below is an overview of our Terms of Service for our "Platform", which means any website, application, or service we offer. You should read the complete Terms of Service documented below the overview because that section (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement. <b><i>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</i></b></p>


                    <h3>Your Relationship with Selfwish</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h3>Selfwish Activity Organizers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Organizers may establish the criteria for their own activity. While there is probably an activity of interest to everyone, not every Selfwish activity is for you. If you can't find the right activity, you can easily organize your own activity.</li>
                        <li>Organized activities may incur a charge.</li>
                        <li>Through our Platform, people will meet and partake in activities, which can lead to expected or unexpected circumstances, of which may or may not be desired. Unfortunately, we cannot control what occurs during the activity organized. With that said; i) Please be mindful of whom you are meeting for an activity, ii) Please be mindful of when you are meeting for an activity, iii) Please be mindful of where you are meeting for an activity, and iv) Please be mindful of why you are meeting for an activity.</li>
                        <li>If anyone is harassing, has harassed or influences you to feel uncomfortable verbally, physically, sexually, emotionally, visually, cyberly or in a different form, please immediately, email Selfwish at useraccount [at] theselfwish.com and if you believe it is necessary either legally, morally or to ensure one's safety, please contact the appropriate legal authorities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Your Content and Content of Others</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You are responsible for your "Content", which means any information, material, or other content posted to our Platform. Your Content must comply with our Terms of Service, which includes the Usage and Content Policies, Activity Policies, Organizer Policies, Trademark Usage Guidelines, and API License Terms. Your Content is also subject to our Intellectual Property Dispute Policies. </li>
                        <li>We do not own the Content that you post. However, we do require that you provide us a license to use this Content in order for us to operate, improve, promote, and protect Selfwish and our Platform for the benefit of you and others.</li>
                        <li> We are not responsible for Content that users post or the communications that users send using our Platform. We generally don't review Content before it's posted. If you see Content that violates our Terms of Service, please report inappropriate Content to us.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Selfwish Platform</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Occasionally, things break. If at any moment, our Platform is not available, working inefficiently, or experiencing other performance issues, please let us know and we will do what is reasonably possible to address applicable issues. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.
                        We are continually improving our Platform. This means that we may modify or discontinue portions of our Platform. </li>
                        <li>By using our Platform, you agree to the limitations of liability and release in our Terms of Service. You also agree to resolve any disputes you may have with us in the manner described in the Terms of Service. Unless you are based in the European Union, you agree to mandatory arbitration and waive your right to seek relief from a judge or jury in a court of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.</li>
                        <li> You may be based in a country where the laws that apply provide for different or additional rights and obligations. These Terms of Service will point out areas of difference.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Terms of Service</h2><hr> 
                    Last Updated: 1/24/23<br>
                    <p>Our Terms of Service contain important information about your legal rights. To make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these gray boxes. These summaries are not part of the official terms, and it is important for you to read the language in each section carefully.</p>

                    <h3 class="mailtabg">1. This Agreement</h3>
                        <h4 class="subtag">1.1 The Agreement.</h4>
                        <p>Selfwish enables you and other users to arrange offline, real-world Selfwish activities. The terms "Selfwish," "we," "us," and "our" include The Selfwish LLC and our corporate parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. We use the terms "you" and "your" to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization's behalf. We use the word "Platform" to mean any website, application, or service offered by Selfwish, including content we offer and electronic communications we send. We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service. We use the terms "Terms of Service" and "Agreement" interchangeably to mean this document together with our Usage and Content Policies, Activity Policies, Organizer Standards, Trademark Usage Guidelines, and API License Terms. Your use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement. If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement. If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">1.2 Revisions to this Agreement</h4>
                        <p> We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement. If you do not wish to accept the revised Agreement, you can close your account.</p>

                    <h3 class="mailtabg">2. Your Account and Usership</h3>

                        <h4 class="subtag">2.1 Eligibility.</h4>
                        <p>Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old. You represent that you are at least 18. Additional eligibility requirements for an activity may be set by any activity organizer. For example, the eligibility requirements for a Selfwish activity may be set by the organizers of that activity.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">2.2 Modification, Suspension, and Termination of Your Account.</h4>
                        <p>We may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Selfwish community, or to protect our brand or Platform. When this happens, we may notify you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination. We also may remove accounts of users who are inactive for an extended period of time. Please email <a href="mailto:useraccount@theSelfwish.com">useraccount@theSelfwish.com</a> if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination has occurred in error.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">2.3 Account Information and Security.</h4>
                        <p>When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address, phone number and a password. Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account). We strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account. You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone is using your password or accessing your account without your permission, email us at <a href="mailto:useraccount@theSelfwish.com">useraccount@theSelfwish.com</a>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">2.4 License to the Selfwish Platform and Services.</h4>
                        <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Selfwish grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Platform in order to access and use the services and features that we make available to you.</p>

                    <h3 class="mailtabg">3. Fees, Payments, and Offers</h3>
                        <h4 class="subtag">3.1 We do not charge Fees for access to Our Platform.</h4>
                        <p>Use of the features on our Platform is free. We may in the future implement a new fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform. If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you notice in advance such as by posting changes on our Platform or sending you an email. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S. dollars.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers.</h4>
                            <p>Organizers may impose fees related to their activity. We reserve the right to deny refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service. Refunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our Payment Policies. Organizers may also have their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit users' ability to receive refunds under our Payment Policies. Payments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider. Please be mindful of the fees charged to you by the Organizer. We cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they promise or as you expect. You should check the refund policy of the Activity Organizer before making any payments to an organizer.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">3.3 Third-party Payment Processors.</h4>
                            <p>An Activity Organizer that uses the Platform to accept payments from other users must comply with the terms and conditions of the third-party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment. Selfwish does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.</p>
                        <h4 class="subtag">3.4 Invoices from Third-parties.</h4>
                            <p>In line with the tax laws of the country where an organizer is using the Platform, an organizer may receive Selfwish invoices from a third-party provider. Such third-party provider invoicing does not in any way impact the rights and obligations agreed to in this Agreement, nor does it impact the fee being charged for the use of the Platform.</p>

You also agree, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, to release organizers from Claims based on an organizer's negligence arising out of or in any way connected with their Content or a Selfwish activity. The law in some countries and states do not allow the release, so these limits may not apply to you. You waive and relinquish all rights and benefits that you have or may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any similar provision of statutory or non-statutory law of any other jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                        You acknowledge that some Selfwish activities carry inherent dangers, such as the risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. By participating in these activities, you understand and agree that you have freely chosen to assume these risks.</p>

                        <p>Our Platform is provided to you "as is" and on an "as available" basis. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties and conditions of any kind, including but not limited to statutory warranties, and the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We also disclaim any warranties regarding (a) the reliability, timeliness, accuracy, and performance of our Platform, (b) any information, advice, services, or goods obtained through or advertised on our Platform or by us, as well as for any information or advice received through any links to other websites or resources provided through our Platform, (c) the results that may be obtained from the Platform, and (d) the correction of any errors in the Platform, (e) any material or data obtained through the use of our Platform, and (f) dealings with or as the result of the presence of marketing partners or other third-parties on or located through our Platform.

Our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount of fees, if any, you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action that may give rise to liability. The limitations set forth above in this Section 8 will not limit or exclude liability for our gross negligence, fraud, or intentional, malicious, or reckless misconduct. Some laws do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability, so these limits may not apply to you. If you are a member based in the EU, you have legal remedies if we cause you loss by our breach or non-performance of our legal obligations, or by our negligence, and these terms do not affect those statutory remedies.</p>
                    <h3 class="mailtabg">9. Dispute Resolution</h3>    
                        <p>If you have a dispute with Selfwish, you agree to try to work it out directly with us first. If we can't work it out, with limited exceptions, you must submit any dispute with us to a neutral arbitrator instead of taking the claim to a court of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action. Users based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law. Selfwish has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other users, although we may try to facilitate a resolution.</p>
                        <h4 class="subtag">9.1 Informal Resolution.</h4>
                            <p>Before making any claim, you and Selfwish agree to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. We use the term "claim" in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation in Selfwish activities. You or Selfwish may initiate this process by sending written notice according to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution. In the event that we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days following receipt of the initial notice, you or Selfwish may bring a claim in accordance with this Section 9. Users based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law.</p>
                        <h4 class="subtag">9.2 Arbitration Agreement.</h4>
                            <p>The arbitration procedures described in this Section 9.2 applies to all users, except for users who are based in the European Union. Section 9.6 sets out the dispute resolution procedures that apply to users who are based in the European Union.</p>
                            <h5 class="sub_sstag">a. Mandatory Arbitration.</h5>
                            <p>Except as set forth in Section 9.3, you agree to submit any claim to JAMS, Inc., or its successor ("JAMS") for final and binding arbitration. In arbitration, certain rights that you or we would have in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal. You and Selfwish are each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law. This agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises during or after any termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Selfwish.</p>
                            <h5 class="sub_sstag">b. Arbitration Time for Filing.</h5>
                            <p>Any claim subject to arbitration must be filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>
                            <h5 class="sub_sstag">c. Arbitration Procedures.</h5>
                            <p>Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires ("JAMS Rules") that are in effect as of the demand for arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Any arbitration hearings will take place in Broward County, Florida or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes. The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">9.3 Exceptions.</h4>
                        <p>You or Selfwish may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Broward County, Florida or any U.S. County where you live or work. You or Selfwish may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Broward County, Florida as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Selfwish pending the completion of arbitration. Selfwish may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Selfwish's right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.</p>
                        <h4 class="subtag">9.4 Arbitration Opt Out.

If you opt out according to this process, then Section 9.2 of this Agreement does not apply to you. This opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.3 (Exceptions), 9.5 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).</p>

                        <h4 class="subtag">9.6 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Users Based in the EU.</h4>
                        <p>If you are a member based in the European Union, the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply. Nothing in this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions of the local law that applies.
